Just a list of quotes that I like.

> If someone has those four things—work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity—I believe that you can learn anything in the world.
<br><cite>—Matt Mullenweg</cite>

> What are Japan’s resources? I’m particularly thinking about traditional aesthetics. I’ve identified four keywords related to this: sensai (delicateness), chimitsu (meticulousness), teinei (thoroughness or attention to detail) and kanketsu (simplicity).
<br><cite>—[Kenya Hara](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/01/04/general/value-judgments/#.V7Dpi44lCxc 'Kenya Hara interview, Japan Times')</cite>

> The future is not where everyone looks for it, “there,” right after the present. It’s not an integral number in a line: 9, 10, 11…It’s somewhere like 6.8 or 7.3. The new design scene nestled in ordinary life will be created by the intellect that perceives the unlimited numbers between two successive integers.
> <br><cite>—Kenya Hara, Designing Design</cite>

> …exploring the infinite number of notes between C and C sharp…
<br><cite>—Aphex Twin</cite>

> The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.
<br><cite>—Bruce Lee</cite>

> Your job as a creator is to engineer simplicity in an otherwise complex system, to leverage technology to reduce the cognitive burden of accomplishing whatever task your user is trying to accomplish… Software should be hard to build and easy to use, not the other way around.
<br><cite>—[Ben Balter](http://ben.balter.com/2016/08/22/ten-ways-to-make-a-product-great/ 'Ten ways to make a product great, Ben Balter')</cite>

> That love of personal autonomy can shortchange a sense of collective responsibility. That skepticism about institutions can yield a “disruption” where imperfect systems are replaced by no system at all, or one where only those making the tech benefit.
<br><cite>—[Anil Dash](https://medium.com/make-better-software/software-matters-in-the-world-f24d25b255d7)</cite>

> All vices are at odds with nature, all abandon the proper order of things.<br>—Seneca

> Overload, clutter and confusion are not attributes of information, they are failures of our design.<br>—Edward Tufte

> This will do.<br>—Kenya Hara
