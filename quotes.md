Just a list of quotes that I like.

> If someone has those four things—work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity—I believe that you can learn anything in the world.
<br><cite>—Matt Mullenweg</cite>

> What are Japan’s resources? I’m particularly thinking about traditional aesthetics. I’ve identified four keywords related to this: sensai (delicateness), chimitsu (meticulousness), teinei (thoroughness or attention to detail) and kanketsu (simplicity).
<br><cite>—[Kenya Hara](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/01/04/general/value-judgments/#.V7Dpi44lCxc 'Kenya Hara interview, Japan Times')</cite>

> The future is not where everyone looks for it, “there,” right after the present. It’s not an integral number in a line: 9, 10, 11…It’s somewhere like 6.8 or 7.3. The new design scene nestled in ordinary life will be created by the intellect that perceives the unlimited numbers between two successive integers.
> <br><cite>—Kenya Hara, Designing Design</cite>

> …exploring the infinite number of notes between C and C sharp…
<br><cite>—Aphex Twin</cite>

> The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.
<br><cite>—Bruce Lee</cite>

> Your job as a creator is to engineer simplicity in an otherwise complex system, to leverage technology to reduce the cognitive burden of accomplishing whatever task your user is trying to accomplish… Software should be hard to build and easy to use, not the other way around.
<br><cite>—[Ben Balter](http://ben.balter.com/2016/08/22/ten-ways-to-make-a-product-great/ 'Ten ways to make a product great, Ben Balter')</cite>

> That love of personal autonomy can shortchange a sense of collective responsibility. That skepticism about institutions can yield a “disruption” where imperfect systems are replaced by no system at all, or one where only those making the tech benefit.
<br><cite>—[Anil Dash](https://medium.com/make-better-software/software-matters-in-the-world-f24d25b255d7)</cite>

> The craft of designing interfaces is a unique skill. It requires an individual to have at least four personal attributes: compassion for other people, abstract problem solving skills, the ability to communicate or detail web/software design ideas, and experience crafting designs and watching people use them.
<br><cite>—[Scott Berkun](http://scottberkun.com/essays/22-the-list-of-reasons-ease-of-use-doesnt-happen-on-engineering-projects/)</cite>

> The web, as it appears at any one moment, is a phantasmagoria. It’s not a place in any reliable sense of the word. It is not a repository. It is not a library. It is a constantly changing patchwork of perpetual nowness.
<br>—<cite>[Adrienne LaFrance](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/raiders-of-the-lost-web/409210/)</cite>

> Design first, program second.
<br><cite>—[UX Booth editorial team](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-interaction-design/)</cite>

> This is how it goes. We put a load of shit into a single web page. This makes the page slow. Slow to load, slow to render. Slow.
<br><cite>—[Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io/articles/designing-for-performance/)</cite>

> All vices are at odds with nature, all abandon the proper order of things.<br>—<cite>Seneca</cite>

> Overload, clutter and confusion are not attributes of information, they are failures of our design.<br>—<cite>Edward Tufte</cite>

> This will do.<br>—<cite>Kenya Hara</cite>

> In place of virtue we have seen an expansion of regulation. This cannot be enough. The virtues are not about what one is allowed to do, but what one is formed to be. They strengthen us to become moral agents, the source of our actions.<br>—<cite>Cardinal Vincent Nichols</cite>

> On estimating: You cannot measure it time it does not take, as my old boss used to say.<br>—<cite>[Ole Thorstensen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0857056689)</cite>

> Don’t write just for other people. Write because you want to understand.<br>—<cite>Sacha Chua</cite>

> Writing to get read makes you careful, responsible, and considerate. It forces you to think as simply, clearly and understandably as possible.<br>—<cite>[iA.net](https://ia.net/topics/take-the-power-back/)</cite>

> The digital world abstracts. One could argue most problems contemporary society faces are problems of over-abstraction.<br>—<cite>[Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/essays/offscreen_interview/)</cite>

> It is easy to think that beauty resides in the realm of creativity. Yet beauty hardly "appears" from nowhere. Recently, I have come to believe that we "discover" it through the cleaning and polishing we do to preserve things as they are. [...] The beauty of a temple garden rests not in the splendid features that were created by a talented designer; rather, its beauty is uncovered through the continual process of cleaning.<br>—<cite>Kenya Hara, <i>White</i></cite>
