I'm proud to be a member of [Hull Art Circle], so delighted to make a website for the group. The site provides a description of the club with instructions that help new members get in touch. There's a list of exhibitions and a programme to show everythingâ€™s up to date.

[Trish Boulton] did the photography. She captured the bright and airy studio during the monthly life drawing session, taking advantage of the natural daylight.

The site is build statically with [Jekyll]. This approach allowed us to focus on the design and content, and to turn this around quickly.

I optimised the website for [speedy performance].  I used the new [srcset] attribute for image sets, and included a single font file.  Compressed styles are rendered the page.

The whole website weights in at 995 KB. So it will fit on a floppy disk, with plenty of room to spare.
