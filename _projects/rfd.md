RFD design and fit out commercial office spaces to modernise and energise the workplace. This project was a full website refresh following our earlier rebrand.

I worked very closely with the client throughout the project, developing the concept with consistent art direction and a minimal style that would show the work well across a range of devices.

The web site is build on ExpressionEngine, with minimal plug-ins to help performance and keep everything easy to update.
