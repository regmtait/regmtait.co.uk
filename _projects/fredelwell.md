Fred Elwell was an artist, based in Beverley. This website supports the launch of a new edition of the book, nearly 20 years after the first.

The book was a labour of love for the authors, and I aimed to get the details across simply and clearly, following a style based on the book design. There was no need for a cms, so I focussed on presenting the information with a streamlined static site and a hand-written responsive layout.
