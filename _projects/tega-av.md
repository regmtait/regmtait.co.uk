For this project, I aimed for a crisp, minimalist look and feel to represent the refinement of good audio visual product design and the bespoke nature of Tega's professional AV solutions.

I first refreshed the branding, tightening up the logo by stripping out the gradients and substituting the stretched Helvetica font for a proper extended one.

The next stage was the web layout. The challenge was to develop a tight yet fluid grid which gracefully changes to meet browser widths across all devices for fully responsive web design.

At the backend, I built the site a custom CMS using [ExpressionEngine](https://ellislab.com/expressionengine). I strived to make it easy for Tega to log in and update every piece of content.

Finally, I initiated some basic SEO keyword research, working it into the content and meta data to give our favourite search engine a helping hand.
