The Green Care Home needed a new website that helps promote their progressive care home, so I was happy to help.

Their previous website had generic copy and stock images, so an early decision was to replace the existing stock photos with real photography. I took the time to [sketch out the shots (pdf, 2MB)] we needed. This helped to communicate with the client, and provided clear direction for the photographer, the excellent [Trish Boulton]. Tricia did an amazing job of capturing the light on a gloomy day in mid-January, and worked sensitively among the elderly residents of the care home.

I then cleaned up the branding and developed a simple content strategy. I helped rewrite the copy before building the CMS with ExpressionEngine. I created html prototypes early on to communicate how the site would work for real across different devices.
