My packing list, forged from travels to South East Asia.

## Bag

[Eagle Creek 45L Cargo Hauler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eagle-Creek-Cargo-Hauler-Duffel/dp/B011ZAYIVK "Eagle Creek Cargo Hauler on Amazon"). It's a lightweight duffel back with backpack straps, suitable for aircraft carry-on. It's soft and small enough to stay with me at all times. I won't be going back to wheeled luggage any time soon. I've got the stealthy black one.

Add a few cheapo packing cubes to keep everything organised and stop bag from feeling overstuffed.

## Daybag

I carry an American Tourister Huemix 10" shoulder bag. Really good, but would replace with something truly flat-packable. Permanent contents:

* Pen and tiny notebook
* Credit card sized pouch for coins <sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup>

## Essentials

* Wallet. Contents: bank card and some cash
* Phone + charger cable + local power adapter
* Watch
* Luggage lock. More of a deterrent. I like the [straight barrelled ones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N3CYKN7/ "Luggage lock on Amazon").
* Sunglasses, in a case with spare sleeve
* Compass. Great for cities and always reliable.

Pack in a zipped sleeve:

* *Passport!* The only things I really need, that and:
* *Cash*‚Äîremember any cash from previous trips
* Paper copy of travel details

## Emergency kit

Contained in a mint tin, wrapped in rubber bands. Nicked the idea from [Brendan Dawes](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm0gUJijFDy/ "Brendan Dawes battered Altoids tin on Instagram").

* Paper copy of passport
* Phone numbers, on paper
* Extra bank card
* Some cash
* Spare house key
* Other bits: clips, mini karabiner, a few plasters, tiny bottle opener

## Laptop or iPad

* Laptop + charger + mouse üê≠ / iPad
* Cheap earphones

## Tourist stuff

* Maps and guidebook. Consider copying pages rather than lugging books around.

## Drawing materials

I love to draw. 

* Pencil case. (Usual stuff: mechanical pencils, brush pen, eraser, carbon ink refill, couple of pens, mini Swiss Army knife <sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup> )
* Putty rubber
* Tiny watercolour set (refresh colours)
* Everyday sketchbook
* Soft A4 or A5 sketchbook (good for life drawing)
* Life drawing materials if needed (a few soft pencils and a sharpener in separate case)
* Small bulldog clip

## First aid kit

* Plasters
* Paper tape
* Sterile swabs
* Some painkillers

## Toiletries

Don't go mad. Everything I need can be bought on arrival. Thai toothpaste tastes the best. Even the cheapest hostels provide shower gel.

* Folding toothbrush, disposable razor
* 100ml or below: sunblock, mosquito repellent, anti-histamine cream, roll-on deodorant

## Clothes

I'll be travelling in the warmest clothes I'll need. Thai trains and buses can be pretty chilly.

* Long sleeved shirt / lightweight hoodie
* 1 pair of socks. Maybe two.
* 5 pairs of underwear
* 5 t-shirts / polo shirts. Aim for lightweight fabrics that are easily hand-washed and dried.
* Everyday jeans
* Alternative lightweight trousers
* Lightweight jacket
* Lightweight hat. For the sun.
* Shorts
* Laundry bag

## Shoes

* One pair of everyday footwear <sup>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</sup>
* Flip flops

## For the journey

* Eyemask or circle scarf for overnight travel. <sup>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</sup>.
* Lubricant for dry eyes on flight (Vaseline)
* Book to read <sup>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</sup>

## Optional

* Dedicated camera + charger, spare battery‚Ä¶
* Travel clothes line <sup>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</sup>
* Instant coffee (though you can buy this anywhere) ‚òïÔ∏è

## Travel prep

* Compare exchange rates. Is it cheaper to exchange or withdraw cash on arrival?
* Haircut
* Single house key on karabiner
* Gifts for hosts?
* Prep phone‚Äîroom for photos, podcasts
* Accurate info in Google calendar‚Äîreally useful
* Put travel docs in the cloud, pics of passport and travel info on phone
* Spare luggage key taped and concealed in exterior pocket
* Weigh luggage. Does everything weigh under 7kg?

<p>[<span id="1">1</span>] Thailand is still cash-based, especially for smaller purchases.</p>
<p>[<span id="2">2</span>] No problems at security so far, even when I had my pencil case checked out. Such a useful thing.</p>
<p>[<span id="3">3</span>] Currently using snazzy Crocs with a fabric upper.</p>
<p>[<span id="4">4</span>] Thailand sleeper trains are really bright, especially on the top bunk.</p>
<p>[<span id="5">5</span>] Books are heavy. Take one book maximum and use Kindle app for anything else.</p>
<p>[<span id="6">6</span>] I had a <a href="http://flexo-line.com" title="Flexo-line website">good Flexo-line one</a>, but I lost it.</p>
