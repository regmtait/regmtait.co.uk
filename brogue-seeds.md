## #163680597 • Epic Adventure

Good one—feel's like an epic adventure. 

Highlights:

* 3 super-Naga friends
* Bafflement about what to enchant
* Pet phoenix and an explosive pixie follower (it didn't last long)
* +5 staff on blinking

Enventually torn apart by furies on level 24.

## 0000 * Goblin Conjurers

Pretty good for for multiple empolwered goblin conjurer pals.

## Black Jellymancer


## 164886418

Excellent level for playing with six staves, powered with rings of wisdom. The first act needs carefully treading. I've got as far as Depth 17, dying a stupid death (forgot to put armour back on).
