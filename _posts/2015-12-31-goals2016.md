## Build tools

Get a working knowledge of [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). Switch from Hammer to [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) for prototyping if I still need it.

## CSS

Finally learn [Flexbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/). Start using the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) syntax convention.

&uarr; Get the above handled by February, so I can focus on the important stuff &ndash; solving design problems for our users

## Writing

Writing a blog post regularly. Get my ideas down even if they seem pretty stupid or half-baked.

## Pencil Aided Design

Draw *every* day. No excuses.
