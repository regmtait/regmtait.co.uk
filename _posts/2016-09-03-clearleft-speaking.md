excerpt: I've enjoyed a weekend in Brighton, learning public speaking at Clearleft.
---

Last weekend I attended a [public speaking workshop](https://clearleft.com/posts/397) run by [Andy Budd](http://andybudd.com/) at [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/). Many of my human skills have atrophied after years in front of a computer so his was a chance to improve. It was also a reason to visit Brighton, a lovely place and hub of the UK's web design community. I enjoyed having a peek into the Clearleft workspace.

Andy is a brilliant speaker as well as an excellent designer and teacher. His [CSS Mastery book](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/12/css_mastery_coming_soon/) helped me in the early days of web standards.

Each member gave small presentation on a subject of interest to us. I spoke about 'why everyone should draw'. We had a group discussion following each one, with Andy leading the group and providing feedback.  The group was friendly and supportive. It was easy to find things to like about the speakers and their talks.

This was followed by a series of exercises, reading the Lewis Carroll poem [Jabberwocky](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky) out loud, over and over again. Andy direct this by breaking down emphasising different parts: volume, pitch, speed and using our *whole bodies* to convey the story. I found using volume tricky.

We then repeated our presentations.  The second time I give the talk it felt natural and authentic.

## My #takeaway points.

The audience does not feel your nerves as much as you do. They're rooting for you, and want to you to #win. They will forgive you.

It's ok to take up space.

Get to know the room in advance.

Public speaking as a learned skill. Improvements come with a practice.
