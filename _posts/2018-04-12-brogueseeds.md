excerpt: I took some time over the Easter weekend to put together a little fan site for Brogue, my favourite Roguelike game.

---

Roguelikes are turn-based computer game with a focus on intricate gameplay and re-playability, often with a world representation using ASCII-based display. The original Rogue was published in 1980 and established the genre. [Brogue] is a recent roguelike by Brian Walker, with a beautiful appearance and intuitive controls.

I built a little site to list some 'dungeon seeds', the strings of numbers that procedurally generate the levels.

The site was a great chance to work with CSS Grid, the excellent new layout module. I followed the wonderful [CSS Grid] videos from [Wes Bos] to get started.

I had a  play with some gratuitous CSS effects too. There's no Javascript anywhere‚Äîthat includes that lightbox effects. Get your [dungeon seeds here] üëç.
