excerpt: I like to play <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">Brogue</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> by Brian Walker. It’s the only game on my computer, and the only Roguelike I&#39;ve played. I’ve learned some valuable life lessons from it.

**A scarcity mindset doesn’t help.** It’s always better to use a consumable than to die.

**Be creative.** How can I combine my resources in new ways? How can I use something that would appear to be a threat to help me? How can the environment work to my advantage?

**Take time over tricky decisions.** Slow my thinking right down, as needed. Planning in advance is essential. It’s useless to blaze into a desperate situation, flailing wildly.

**However, I can only plan so far ahead.** The long term future is out of my control.

**Do I even need to solve a problem?** Can I find a way round an obstacle, or avoid the entire task altogether?
