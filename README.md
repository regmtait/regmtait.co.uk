# regmtait.co.uk

My website, served up at [regmtait.co.uk](http://regmtait.co.uk)

# Overview

This site is a bunch of static files generated by Jekyll. The challenge was to see if I could replicate my previous CMS site with Jekyll without too much fudging.

## Features

* Homepage projects selected by category
