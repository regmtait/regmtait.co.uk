Branding questions, curbed from multiple sources.

## Brand values
What position, if any do you already own in the prospect’s mind?

## What position do you want to own?
Better to select a position that no one else has a firm grip on than go head to head with a marketing leader.

## What is your mission statement?
This is a sentence or two that explains your company’s goals. It should also weave in some information about what your organisation is and why it exists.

## Product/services positioning statement
This is like your company mission statement, only more specific to your offerings.

## Benefit of your product/service?
Think about how exactly you’re helping your target audience.

## Messages your brand needs to communicate
Why does your brand matter to your target audience?

## Value proposition
How do you solve your customers’ problems? This should summarize why someone should buy your product or invest in your services.

## Brand Attributes
Think about your brand’s personality. How would you describe it?

What attributes and/or emotions do you want associated with your brand? For example…

* mature vs youthful
* playful vs sophisticated
* economical vs luxurious
* literal vs abstract
* dventurous vs secure
* disciplined vs exciting
* approachable vs authoritative
